# Memory Game Project

This is a browser-based card matching game. 

How to Play:

During each turn:
• The player clicks one card to flip it over and reveal its underlying icon.
• The player then clicks and turns over a second card, trying to find the matching card with the same icon.
• If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
• If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down to starting position.
• The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
